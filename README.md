## 1. Setup

### 1.1 What is a good business idea?

Enterprising Oxford (Business Model Canvas Explained | Enterprising Oxford, 2021) explains the business model canvas this way:

> “ The Business Model Canvas is a business tool used to visualise all the building blocks when you want to start a business, including customers, route to market, value proposition and finance.”

There are also blocks in the BMC. They are all listed below.

   > 1. Customer Segments: Who are the customers? What do they think? See? Feel? Do?
   > 2. Value Propositions: What’s compelling about the proposition? Why do customers buy, use? 
   > 3. Channels: How are these propositions promoted, sold and delivered? Why? Is it working? 
   > 4. Customer Relationships: How do you interact with the customer through their ‘journey’? 
   > 5. Revenue Streams: How does the business earn revenue from the value propositions?
   > 6. Key Activities: What uniquely strategic things does the business do to deliver its proposition? 
   > 7. Key Resources: What unique strategic assets must the business have to compete? 
   > 8. Key Partnerships: What can the company not do so it can focus on its Key Activities? 
   > 9. Cost Structure: What are the business’ major cost drivers? How are they linked to revenue?


Each of these blocks needs to be accurately filled in, and revisited regularly to ensure the business model is still accurate – its a good thing to do before you register a business.


### 1.2 What is a business canvas model?

According to entrepreneur.com (Petch, 2017) there are 5 signs that you’re business idea is good. Below I will list all of them with some context.

1. It solves a problem

> Solving a problem means delivering a solution that makes a sizeable number of people’s lives easier. The problem doesn’t have to be one that nobody else is tackling, it can just be as easily be a problem that no one has dealt with effectively.

2. It’s scalable

> Scalability is the potentional of your business opportunity to grow and be applied to an ever- increasing market. Whether it’s actually ready to scale depends on you building this into your business plan and investors are likely to look for both the potentional and the readiness. After all, returns on investments come from the ability of those investments to grow and prosper in the years ahead. Can you expand on your idea, make it flexible and resilient, monetise it throughout and remodel it if necessary?

3. You can sell at an attractive price and make a good profit

> Finding the right price for the goods or services you’re providing is essential, because no matter how good the idea or how well it solves the problem, if the price isn’t right, people won’t buy.
 
4. It isn’t easy to copy

> Coming up with something truly unique is difficult enough, but keeping it that way is even harder once other people hear about it. There are plenty of cases of companies filing lawsuits about similar products and services, whether it’s smartphones, taxis or vacuum cleaners and while some have managed to corner the market almost entirely, its often down to shrewd strategic moves.

5. Trust your gut, but not at the expense of your head

> Finally, one of the keys with any new idea is really to be honest with yourself. If you have a flash of inspiration followed by a handful of nagging doubts, it’s easy to set them aside because they don’t fit with the version of events you prefer. You need to be honest though.


### 1.3  What is our business idea?

our idea is a company that makes applications for customers. This is possible in package form with a certain format that can be adjusted. What is also possible is a application completely custom made for the customer. Once the applications are created, we provide a service to maintain and host them. We also made a business canvas to further explain this.

### 1.4 What feedback did we get from experts on our canvas?

   *Freerk*

   > - Have more details.
   > - For a company it is important to know why you are better than another company.
   > - Customers are also important: (who are they and why do they choose your company?)
   > - After you figured out these points you can look at the costs, income and finance.
   
   *Marijn*
   
   > - With key activities I would be a bit more specific about how your company differentiates from other companies. eg report the package form in it.
   > - With revenue streams you could say that you consider that maintenance as a subscription model.
   > - With customer segment i would be a bit more specific and add for example: start-ups that want to have a site cheaply and quickly and easily.
   > - At key propositions i would also add: can deliver fast sites through formats.

## 2 Getting your first customers

### 2.1 Ways to find your first customers

Here a some ways to find your first customers:
- Make a list of people you have already met that could be interested in your products or services.  
  > Do some research on who are most likely to be customers.
- Search for local business that could be interested in your products or services.
  > Local business could be potential customers but also can help you with finding customers
- Show off what you have already made.
  > This shows potential customers what you are capable of.
- Build a website and make use of search engine optimization. 
  > This way there is a chance a customer finds your business from a search engine.

### 2.2 Social media
Social media is also a good way to find your first customers. With social media it is possible to find potential customers and to advertise your business.
With social media platforms like: [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com) and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com) you can easily reach out to potential customers. 

Also it is a good idea to setup your social media pages. So when a potential customer visits your page you want to earn their interest in your business. 
With social media advertising it is possible to target specific audience. This way you can find potential customers that meet your market criteria.

## 3. How to build and maintain customer relationships?


Previously we talked about on how to get your first customers. As we already know there are some ways to find new customers and we have also seen that social media is a great tool to find new customers, but also to maintain customer relations.

In todays digital world, customer have a lot to say, it takes just seconds for customer to say that your business and/or product is the best or the worst. I will give you more information on how to find customers and keep a good customer relationship.

### 3.1 What is customer relationship?

Customer relations refers to the process used by businesses to engage with customers and foster long-term relationships with them. Right from assisting customers with their day-to-day queries to creating long-term policies that lead to customer success, customer relations encompasses a lot of activities. When done right, it can lead to positive outcomes such as higher customer retention, increased customer lifetime value (CLV), and stronger customer relationships. (Cornell, 2021)

### 3.2 Why is customer relationship important?

A good customer relationship is important for a business, because it means that the people trust you and you can most likely call them your loyal customers. These loyal customers will repeatedly buy from your business, which is beneficial for an organization. For example, remember when you order pizza? You probably order from the same pizzeria every time, because you trust them and you are their loyal customer.

### 3.3 How to build a Rock-Solid customer relationship?

Building a good customer relation takes a lot effort, time, and requires you to establish trust with your customers. 

Here are two ways to build a strong customer relationship:

#### Customer Experience

According to a study by Gartner, when it comes to making a purchase, 64% of customers find customer experience more important than price. Apple is a great example, the customer experience starts with opening the box, it takes a couple of seconds to open the box. That is all part of the customer experience and helps developing customer relations

#### Customer Service

According to Microsoft, 96% of consumers across the globe consider customer service as an important factor in their choice of loyalty to a brand. For example, When something goes not as intended you get angry and frustrated, you want help and go to the customer service, but the customer service is not adequate and you get even more frustrated and angry. The trust is gone and high chance of losing these customers, so a good customer service is important for the relation.

Here are two more ways to build that relationship according to Cornell: 

#### Be Willing to Exceed Expectations

Customers today expect more than simply a product that works great or a service that helps them save money. Amidst such high expectations, you need to raise the bar on what your company offers and strive to exceed customer expectations. 

<strong>Now, we understand that under-promise, and over-deliver isn’t always possible. However, when you do that, customers can’t help but keep coming back.</strong>

There are a lot of ways to exceed customer expectations. For example, you can deliver a product or service faster than anticipated. Simply tell the customer that they can expect their product within 7 days and try to deliver it well before that. 

#### Nothing Beats Personalized Experiences

At the end of the day, customers buy from you as they are able to relate to your brand. It can be something as simple as the color of your logo or the values your business represents through social corporate responsibilities. 

<strong>Every customer that engages with your brand is unique. A personalized customer experience will make them feel special in a crowded marketplace.</strong>

To foster effective customer relations, get to know your customers and understand their likes or dislikes. Greet them by their names, communicate with them on the channels they prefer, and always remember their past interactions or activities. 

Now, customers are different while some customers prefer short conversations, others can chat with anyone. Therefore, you can try to create customer personas and segment your customers based on their personalities.
